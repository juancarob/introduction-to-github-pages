When an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) is diagnosed, the most common
response is its treatment. However, endovascular treatment and microsurgical
intervention show a non-negligible morbidity (5%-7%) and mortality (1%-2%) risk [1].
Indeed, UIAs are relatively common, with an estimated prevalence of up to 6% [2,3]
and, given that many of them never break (only 1/3 in a life-long follow-up cohort [1]),
physicians frequently find themselves in the dichotomy of treating them or not [4].
