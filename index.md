Rupture of intracranial aneurysms is the most common cause of spontaneous
subarachnoid bleeding, related to high morbidity and mortality rates. However,
intracranial aneurysms have a higher prevalence than that due to their spontaneous
rupture rate, exacerbated by the risks associated with occlusion intervention, which
motivates the development of technological tools to support clinical diagnosis and
endovascular occlusion intervention planning. In particular, the aneurysm dome is
sensitive to applied loads in the contiguous surroundings to the aneurysm neck. Indeed,
this region shows high complexity due to the arterial wall nature of the pathology. This
work presents preliminary statistical analysis results of a thin shell model, with varying
material and geometrical parameters, under a localized load emulating the effect of a
microcatheter pressing the neck area. In a selection of 34 cases, we show that
dimensionality reduction techniques such as Isomap can help determine non-trivial
regions of interest under concentrated loads, leading to more general machine learning
classification models for sensitive area identification.
